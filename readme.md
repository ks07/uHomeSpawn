uHomeSpawn - Spawn functionality implemented using uHome
===========

This plugin requires uHome to be installed and active on your Bukkit server. The setting enableUnlock must be set to true in your uHome folder's config.yml, and you must be using a version later than v1.5.3.
No release of uHome is currently compatible with this plugin - you must build from the latest source here on github.

This plugin allows your players to teleport to a centralised 'spawn', while still obeying restrictions put in place with uHome - i.e. warmups and cooldowns.

Commands & Permissions:

    /spawn - (uhome.spawn) - Takes you to the current world's spawn.
    /setspawn - (uhome.setspawn) - Sets the world's spawn to your position.
